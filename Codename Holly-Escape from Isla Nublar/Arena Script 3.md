# The Final Colosseum Battle

*This time, the scene opens with a much larger Holly on standby in the right tunnel, paralleling with the fact she is now one of the well-known fighters, since they all came from the right side before.*

*The crowd cheers as the scene changes to Muldoon starting a phone call in the announcing box.*

Muldoon: "(1) Hello. I'm sure you know what I'm calling about, if you've been checking your calendar. (murmurs on the phone in response) 
(2) Yes, today is the day we finally dethrone that Dilo. It's been causing us concern for far too long now. (murmurs object to his decision)
(3) I don't care what the masses will think! This dinosaur is too dangerous to maintain!
(4) We had three maintenance workers eaten alive in one damn month!
(5) If you had seen the aftermath...\*urp*
(6) I need you to send in our biggest contender. This monstrosity dies today. (a response along the lines of 'yes sir')"

*the scene pans back to the arena, and Muldoon announces Holly's entrance into the ring.*

M: "(7) Alright, everybody! Tonight we have a VERY special match for you all, and you'll all see why in just a moment....
(8) First up: you all know her very well by now: the vibrant, fast-as-lightning, *unstoppable*â€¦HOLLY!!!!!"

*The crowd cheers wildly as the fan favorite champion of the arena enters into the ring.*

M: "(9) Now, for the twist I hinted at before, I hope you all are ready for the battle of a lifetime!
(10) On the other side of the ring, we have our biggest fighter coming out of retirement to face off against the *undefeated* champion!"

*Very large footsteps are heard to the left as the screen shudders.*

M: "(11) Everyone in the crowd give a *loud* welcome to the hulking, beastly, *ferocious* dino-fighting veteran:
(12) Cataclysm!"

*A huge T-Rex is ushered into the ring*, before making a loud roar. The entire crowd has a "wow" moment as they begin cheering louder. As the T-Rex steps forward, the battle begins.*
