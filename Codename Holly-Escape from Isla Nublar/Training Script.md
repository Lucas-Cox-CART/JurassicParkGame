*In the hallway, there are small hills to jump over.* 

//System// "(6) Excellent. Ahead of you are hurdles to test your vertical agility. (7) Your ability to jump will now be evaluated."

*Various sizes of hurdles with different widths will need to be crossed in order to get through the tunnel.*

*Once they are through the tunnel, a Compy is shown to the right. It doesn't seem to be moving or reacting at the moment.*

//System// "(8) Mobility and agility evaluation complete. (9) We will now begin the evaluation of your combat capabilities."
