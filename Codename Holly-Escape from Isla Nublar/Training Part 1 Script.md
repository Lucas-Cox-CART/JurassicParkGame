*Scene fade-in*

//System// "(1) // beginning simulation generation... //
(2) // initializing HUD... //"

*The screen fades in from black. A small dinosaur is standing in a white-colored void.*

//System// "(3) Welcome, ```Codename: Holly```. This program will guide you through your virtual training protocols scheduled by a ```[REDACTED]```
(4) First skillset: Basic movement evaluation."

*Arrows appear directing the player right. A visual indicator that shows the controls will also appear in the background, telling the player movement controls.*

//System// "(5) Navigate to the room ahead. This exercise will test your mobility capabilities."

*In the hallway, there are small hills to jump over.* 

//System// "(6) Excellent. Ahead of you are hurdles to test your vertical agility. 
(7) Your ability to jump will now be evaluated."

*Various sizes of hurdles with different widths will need to be crossed in order to get through the tunnel.*

*Once they are through the tunnel, a Compy is shown to the right. It doesn't seem to be moving or reacting at the moment.*

//System// "(8) Mobility and agility evaluation complete. 
(9) We will now begin the evaluation of your combat capabilities."

*The player is then prompted to press Mouse 1 in order to attack the Procompsognathus. The Compy does not respond. It takes around 2-3 hits to kill.*

//System// "(10) Very good. Continue attacking Procompsognathi. They will now retaliate against your attacks. 
(11) Remember, consuming the remains of prey helps to maintain a healthy physique.
(12) It may also be worth noting that you can consume recently-killed dinosaurs."

*More Compys appear, about 3 or 4.*

//System// "(13) Combat evaluation complete. Your abilities are above par."

*A short pause.*

//System// "(14) Your benefactor would like to see you in action before sending you into the arena. (15) You will now undergo another short combat course. 
(16) Continue to the mock-arena simulation."

*The player moves forward , still fighting Compys on the way there. Upon arrival, the player fights a weaker, simplified version of the Deinonychus. After the fight, the player is greeted by the simulation AI again.*

//System// "(17) Excellent showmanship, ```Codename: Holly```. You are ready for the arena.
(18) // Initiating power-down sequence... //"

*A gray white-out plays over the screen, and the player is then shown the simulation room. A VR headset hangs from the ceiling, and Holly is in a harness. She struggles to get out, but it releases her on its own. 


# Snap Back to Reality

*A scientist sits behind a reinforced glass wall with a small opening for sound to get through.*

Scientist: "(1) Ah, you're finished with the training." (he suddenly stops paying attention to Holly to mark down results on his clipboard) 
Scientist, mumbling to himself (make the text in the box small): "(2) Subject is disoriented by the simulation removal process....
(3) Okay, you're free to go. We're going to transport you off to your den now."

*The player then leaves the room, and is transported to the den. The player is introduced to save points (nests) that heal you to full upon first activating them. Afterwards, the player Sleeps, and the first arena script starts next scene.*
