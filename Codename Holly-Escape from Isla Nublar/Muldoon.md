In this universe, Muldoon is the announcer of the arena. He is initially surprised to see [[Codename-Holly]] in the arena, considering she is an early juvenile being pitted against adult dinos. However, he begins to fear her progress as the youngest and fastest-climbing champion of the arena. Eventually, when she breaks out of the arena and causes a havoc, Muldoon seeks to put a stop to her himself. He has always kept weapons in a safe place in case of an emergency this bad.
