One of three dinosaurs fought in the arena. She is a Deinonychus that serves as the first enemy in the game. She has moderate health, but high speed. Attacks are as follows:

- Swipe: performed when the player is in close proximity in front of the enemy. It does moderate damage because it isn't very telegraphed, but is still a punishment for not moving. 
- Lunge: Well-telegraphed, the raptor moves away and turns around, readying to jump. It then jumps through the air, and will do a large amount of damage and knock back the player if they do not dodge out of the way of the attack.

At two thirds of her health, Dionysus roars and initiates the second phase. She begins to move much quicker, and moves out of the way of most melee attacks. At this point in the fight, Holly unlocks her second ability: Acid spit. 

- Attacks become much faster in this stage, particularly lunges; the telegraphing of the lunge should stay the same so that there is still time to *prepare* to react, but if this is too difficult to program, then the attack can just be sped up overall.
