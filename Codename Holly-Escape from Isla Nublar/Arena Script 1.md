# Battle One - Deinonychus

*The player starts off with the screen fading in from black and Holly entering the arena from the left. Muldoon announces her arrival:

Muldoon: "(1) …And for today, ladies and gentleman, we have a special contender in the ring! (2) This new challenger may *seem* a tad too young to be fighting, but her submission details were very confident in her ability. (3) So, without further ado, please welcome our Dilophosaurus newcomer: (4) HOLLY!!!"

*some reluctant cheering from the crowd as the scene moves to Muldoon in the announcing box

\[Muldoon, under his breath:] "(5) Are we sure this is the right dino? I don't think it'll last long against the Deinonychus...(assistant responds inaudibly)…(6) are you sure? Alright..."

*The scene returns to the arena.

M: "(7) And for her contender, you all know this feathered menace well... (8) With a record of 5 brutal kills under her belt, on the other side of the ring we have the vicious, *bloodthirsty* - (9) DIONYSUS!!"

*The crowd gives a much louder cheer for the feathered Deinonychus

M: "(10) Now, if you want my opinion, this new contender is no match for [[Dionysus (Ethan - Read This)]], but we've seen our fair share of underdogs in this arena, haven't we?"

*crowd cheers "Yeah!"

M: "(11) Now, without further ado, let's get ready for a bloody battle!"

# Gameplay Starts

*Battle music starts and the player gains control of Holly. A tutorial appears that tells the player how to move - a to move left, d to move right, space to jump, left click to make a melee attack, and shift to dodge out of the way of attacks. The player is also able to heal from attacks they make, as long as they come into contact with bits of meat or blood that enemies give off.

The Deinonychus is a pretty fast foe with two basic attacks:

- Swipe: performed when the player is in close proximity in front of the enemy. It does moderate damage because it isn't very telegraphed, but is still a punishment for not moving. 
- Lunge: Well-telegraphed, the raptor moves away and turns around, readying to jump. It then jumps through the air, and will do a large amount of damage and knock back the player if they do not dodge out of the way of the attack.

# After the First Fight

*The crowd is surprised the small dinosaur was so easily victorious. Muldoon is baffled that such a well-performing small-class dinosaur was finished off

Muldoon: "(12) Well, I'll be, folks. I didn't know dinosaurs like that could move so fast...(nervous chuckle) (13) To all our surprise, the victory goes to Holly, who I think will bring us a great many more surprises in future matches!"

*The crowd cheers, and the player is given a prompt to roar by pressing ctrl, which they can now do at any time. This keybind will later be used to make a stunning shriek, the third ability usable by the player.

*The player is then told to return to the left entrance of the arena by a human whistling Holly over and an indicator. This leads to a screen transition that send the player to Holly's den.

# Holly's Den - First Visit

*The player is returned to Holly's nest. Henry makes his first appearance after the player activates the nest. He opens a hatch in a wall of the den to speak to Holly.*

Henry: "(1) Excellent work out there, Codename: Holly. You did well for a first test."
*When Holly tilts her head, Henry assumes she has forgotten him.*
H: "(2) Ah, I've almost forgotten how long it's been since you'd seen me, with how long you were in battle conditioning."

*Holly is a little suspicious of this character, making a low snarling sound.*

H: "(3) Now, now, settle down, I don't mean you any harm. In fact, I was the one who funded your training protocols. (4) It was clearly a success; nobody would have thought a young juvenile like you could prove its own, and I have the betting profits to prove it...(he laughs to himself) 
(5) I have a feeling you won't have any problem demolishing the next competitor. If anything, they'll have to bring in stronger contestants to match your strength. 
(6) If you can prove your superiority, I can offer you a way out of this place. You could come with me, and we'd start an army of unstoppable Dilophosaurs.
(7) Ho-ho-ho, this plan is all coming together..."

*Henry closes the hatch. Afterwards, the player is told to sleep.*

## At this point, the optional Extra Credit Minigame would happen, if we choose to implement it., most likely being available every round.
