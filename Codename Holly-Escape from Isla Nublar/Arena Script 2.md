# Battle Two - Pachyrhinosaurus

*The scene opens to another battle in the arena; a Pachyrhinosaurus is wrestling with various workers in the opposite tunnel that are trying to bring the dinosaur into the ring.*

Muldoon: "(1) Alright folks, tonight we have another heavyweight match. Now, if we just wait a moment for the crew to bring her out...."

*The Pachyrhino snorts and snarls as the crew pushes it into the ring, poking at it with shock sticks when it retaliates. As its head rears into view for the crowd, Muldoon ushers it in:*

M: "(2) A stubborn one, isn't she boys? (3) Let's hear it for Bertha, the brutish, stubborn, and *formidable* Pachyrhino!"

*The fight starts with Bertha charging towards Holly, and the player must either dodge toward her or jump over, though it is very hard to time. To do decent damage, Bertha must be stunned using the unlocked ability, a stunning roar that stops Bertha in her tracks and makes her susceptible to acid spit to the face. This causes her to roll over, revealing her soft, fragile underbelly.*



M: "(4) I'm astonished, folks! This dino is more than capable of taking down tough herbivores five times her size! (5) That was quite some clever thinking in the arena, too! I don't want to jinx it, but we might have a potential *Apex Predator* on our hands!!"

*The crowd chants for Holly, hoping she becomes a powerful and memorable arena fighter.*

*After the match, Muldoon discusses Holly with other personnel in a back room.*

Muldoon: "(1) So we still don't know who created that Dilo?"
Admin: "(2) Like I've said before, the submission was entirely anonymous. It is within their rights to remain so."
M: "(3) Still, we've both seen how easily it destroys other dinosaurs."
A: "(4) I understand your concern, but Holly has already garnered a lot of attention for us in the entertainment market. It would make more sense to keep her around."
M: *audible sigh* "(5) You're right. Just... 
(6) Keep an eye on it, okay?"
A: "(7) Will do, Muldoon."

# Holly's Den (Second Visit)

*The scene plays out as before; Holly is given a portion of the Pachyrhino to feast upon. Once she is done eating, she heads to her nest, before being interrupted once more by Wu.*

Henry: "(1) Beautifully done, once again, Holly. You are proving yourself to be quite capable."

*Holly snorts in disgust, appalled at his attempts to sweet talk her after what he's put her through.*

Henry: "(2) Still not a fan of my methods? (3) Heh, well, I hope you'll change your tune soon. You have a long road ahead of you, and I hope I can make it up to you. (4) After all, you are the key component to my plan..."

*Henry closes the hatch once again, walking away slowly. Holly sits for a moment, wondering what he has in store for her. The player is told to sleep once again, and Holly lies down to rest.*
