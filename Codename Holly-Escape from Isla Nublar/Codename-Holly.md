Codename: Holly is a heavily genetically-engineered Dilophosaurus created by [[Henry Wu]]. She possesses increased poison potency, faster reflexes, and a size much closer to that of a pre-historic Dilophosaurus, as opposed to the smaller, less volatile version previously produced by In-Gen.


[[Henry Wu]] initially puts her in the arena to strengthen her and see what she is capable of. He also intends to use money from bets to fund his plan to clone Holly in the future. He plans to steal her in the dead of night with the help of undercover assistants working at Jurassic Park. However, his plans go awry when Holly breaks out of the arena and escapes.
